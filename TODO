===========

* Changing cursor position (either by keypress or mouse click) should reparse back

Should also work for cases like: outer( inner(

NEW FUNCTIONALITY/FEATURES
==========================

* Memory of Incremental Search strings

* Metric reporting (Function length, LOC)

* Turck-mmcache integration

* Project/Live site editing

* Tabs: with context menu

* Change the text on the taskbar button to be more meaningful

* class view: when there are multiple files with the same class names, it
would be nice if the file name is directly appended in the class view,
not only when clicking on it (or the diff to the other file names ;))

This can be implemented using a treeview with classes under the files
and under an All Files item

* Print current PHP file, using Anjuta code.

* Implement Ctrl+Space toolbar popup

> And it would be standard-conform (to ms visual studio and some others)
> to have Ctrl+Shift+Space = show hint to current function [helpful if
> your'e changing the code and not writing new calls] and Ctrl+Space =
> Show function dropdown immediateley.

CODE CLEANUP AND MISC CHANGES
=============================

* Take out gtkscintilla wrapper
