            applying unnecessary patches
          
2005-10-14  Andy Jeffries <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * GtkCombo's changed to
            GtkEntry in Find and Replace dialogs, as no history was being
            kept - when/if I do actually do that feature they'll be
            GtkComboBoxes anyway
          * Tweaks to Find/Replace - Escape, Enter key
            presses works, close is consistent, not found wraps
          * Find dialog should close on clicking close,
            not just hide
          * Open Selected failed to check if file exists before opening, hence 
            asks to create in each folder that is open (new GNOME-VFS prob)

          * Changed GtkCombo to GtkComboBox to fix problem with Change all
            fonts/size under Dropdown
          * AMD64 fixes and work to stop crash with unsaved files  
          
2005-10-12  Andy Jeffries <andy@gphpedit.org>

            preferences box is shown, some needless box stuff

            case-insensitive, as are php/sql/css function/property names

            Rename actually gets the full URI rather than just the old
            filename

            untitled, type text and quit chosing to discard changes crashes
            with segfault

          * Sorts plugin menu in alphabetical order

2004-11-03  Andy Jeffries <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * Muntyan (someone I met off IRC) converted gPHPEdit to use a local
            statically built version of GtkScintilla2 to aid getting gPHPEdit

2004-10-01  Andy Jeffries <andy@gphpedit.org>

            There are quite a few items that have been done that aren't in the ChangeLog below - so lets try
            to bring it up to date....
          
          * Used GNOME-VFS now so you can open/save files to/from FTP/SCP/SFTP locations (and indeed any other type
            of location supported by GNOME-VFS)
          * Updated syntax highlighting to support PHP5 keywords
          * By editing the settings file (~/.gnome2/gPHPEdit) you can now change what files are
            recognised as PHP files (the separator is a comma - NO spaces)
          * Opens with a blank page by default, if you haven't changed it and open a file
            the Untitled page is replaced by the file you choose to open.

2004-09-16  Andy Jeffries <andy@gphpedit.org>

            Wow!  Really looks like I haven't done anything for ages, I have but
            I've forgotten to put it in here.  Here is a list of some of the things
            done:

          * Fixed the fact that changes to the Line Number size don't show
          * Moved to GtkFileChooser from GtkFileSelection
          * Implemented plugins (although still possibly buggy)

2004-04-08  Andy Jeffries <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * Fixed a few bugs from the bugs list, mainly crash bugs

2004-04-07  Andy Jeffries <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * UTF-8 and other code pages now work.  It works by converting on the fly from the user's locale to UTF-8 
            and back to their locale when saving
          * Recently opened files menu implemented
          * File open dialog remembers last opened folder (unless you have an active file open, in which case it still
            reverts to that folder).

2004-03-10  Andy Jeffries <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * UTF-8 works (although other code pages such as ISO-8859-1 don't!

2004-03-10  Andy Jeffries <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * As there have been quite a few fixes, I've decided to do an interim release.

2004-03-10  Andy Jeffries <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * Class browser doesn't update (slow) if it isn't currently shown - speeds up opening of files for those people 
            that don't use the class browser.

2004-03-04  Andy Jeffries <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * Implemented brace matching (properly) - and it works :-)

2004-02-25  Andy Jeffries <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * Fixed crash bug when Find dialog is closed using WM X button rather than close

2004-02-15  Tim Jackson <tim@timj.co.uk>

          * Fixed gtkhtml2 dependencies in RPM spec file

2004-02-13  Andy Jeffries  <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * OK, preferences code is in there and seems to be working.  This version is a pre-1.0 beta 
            but it seems a lot more stable in use than 0.4.3 (due to the number of bugs I've fixed)

2004-02-08  Andy Jeffries  <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * I've started doing the preferences code.  The dialog has been designed for a while, but there's been no code.
            It now makes a copy of the preferences, the code to retrieve a list of fonts is done and the code to determine
            when a syntax highlighting style (e.g. PHP Single-quoted String) changes.

2004-02-03  Andy Jeffries  <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * Will these version numbers be consistent?  After a lot of soul searching (and discussions with a few users), 
            I've decided to make this the pre-1.0 version.  A lot of people are using it day-in-day-out and it's stable.
            However, I've added a couple of new features to this version - so I'll put it out for testing before going
            to 1.0.
          * Upgrading to Pango fonts bug fixed (KEPT prefixing with ! every time)
          * Multiple files open from selection dialog implemented (thanks Leszek)

2004-02-03  Andy Jeffries  <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * Changed version to 0.4.9 (ready for testing locally before changing back to 0.5.0 for release)

2004-01-30  Andy Jeffries  <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * Forced upgrading to Pango rendering is complete (message box on start)
          * Implemented bug fix for multiple calltip popups (bug 55, Urkle)

2004-01-30  Andy Jeffries  <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * Online help now works without hanging the app (although will break if an external link or an anchor is present)

2004-01-30  Andy Jeffries  <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * configure.in: Updated to 0.5.0
          * Close page now moves the focus back a page rather than to the first page
          * The start of online help is in there, but the app hangs on closing the help window

          * configure.in: Updated to 0.4.3 to avoid conflicts with 0.4.2 (in testing)
          * src/main_window.c: (main_window_create_panes), src/main_window_callbacks.c: (classbrowser_show),
            (classbrowser_hide), src/preferences.c: (save_classbrowser_position):
            Properly implemented Show/Hide Classbrowser, previous version didn't
            actually resize the pane, nor remember it's status upon restarting.

          * configure.in: Updated version number to 0.4.2 to reflect change below
          * src/main_window_callbacks.c: (classbrowser_show),
            (classbrowser_hide), src/main_window_callbacks.h, src/main_window_menu.h:
            Implemented Show/Hide Classbrowser feature requested by Tim Jackson.

            src/tab.c: (tab_set_general_scintilla_properties): All updated to reflect 
            preference for turning off line wrapping in response to feature request from
            Erik Williamson <erik@cpsc.ucalgary.ca>

2003-06-24  Andy Jeffries  <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * configure.in: Changed version number to 0.4.0 as no bugs have been
            found in code folding or keyboard macros.  Still need to define
            keyboard shortcuts for code folding, but that won't stop it being
            released now.

2003-06-20  Andy Jeffries  <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * configure.in: Changed version number to 0.3.85 for testing (in RPM
            form) the latest fixes for keyboard macro recording.

2003-06-17  Andy Jeffries  <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * Implemented keyboard macro recording, updated version to 0.3.8 (ready for 0.4 when
            finished testing both new areas of functionality)

2003-06-17  Andy Jeffries  <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * src/main_window.c: (Note: prepare-ChangeLog.pl kept reporting 
            a segfault) Fixed window title not to have a hanging "-"

2003-06-17  Andy Jeffries  <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * src/tab.c, src/tab_php.c, src/preferences.h: (Note: prepare-ChangeLog.pl kept reporting

          * src/main_window.c: (update_app_title): Removed the version number from the title
            of the main window.  This wasn't standar but was useful during the early days of
            development.

2003-06-08  Andy Jeffries  <andy@gphpedit.org>
          
            After tagging CVS as Release_0_3_0 I found I had knackered the dependancies 
            trying to get it to work with Dennis Houy's GtkScintalla2.

2003-06-08  Andy Jeffries  <andy@gphpedit.org>

          * configure.in: Updated version number to be 0.3.0

            use switch_to_file_or_open to open a new file, should
